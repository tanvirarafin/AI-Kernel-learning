# Module 4: The Epilogue (Fused Bias-Add and ReLU implementations)

## Overview
This module focuses on implementing efficient epilogue operations that fuse element-wise computations with main kernels. We'll learn how to implement fused bias-addition and activation functions.

## Key Concepts
- Epilogue fusion strategies
- Memory-efficient activation functions
- Pipeline optimization
- Custom epilogue operations
- Bandwidth-bound vs compute-bound optimizations

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
1. How to implement fused epilogue operations
2. Techniques for memory-efficient activation functions
3. How to optimize pipeline performance with epilogues
4. Strategies for balancing compute and memory bandwidth
