## Verification Tips

```cpp
// Verify kernel results
bool verify(float *gpu, float *cpu, int n, float tolerance = 1e-5) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        float diff = fabs(gpu[i] - cpu[i]);
        if (diff > tolerance) {
            printf("Mismatch at %d: GPU=%.4f CPU=%.4f\n", i, gpu[i], cpu[i]);
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

// Timing template
float timeKernel(cudaStream_t stream = 0) {
    cudaEvent_t start, stop;
    cudaEventCreate(&start);
    cudaEventCreate(&stop);
    cudaEventRecord(start, stream);
