# Solutions / Reference Implementations

This directory contains reference solutions for the exercises.

## How to Use

1. **Try the exercise first!** Don't look at solutions until you've attempted the problem.
2. **Compare your solution** with the reference
3. **Understand the differences** - there may be multiple valid approaches
4. **Use as a learning tool** - study the patterns used
