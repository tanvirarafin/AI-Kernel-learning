# Module 3: Tiled MMA (Using Tensor Cores via CuTe atoms)

## Overview
This module explores Tensor Core operations using CUTLASS 3.x MMA (Matrix Multiply Accumulate) operations. We'll learn how to compose MMA atoms for efficient tensor computations.

## Key Concepts
- MMA atom composition
- Tensor Core instruction mapping
- Fragment-based computation
- Synchronization strategies
- Performance optimization for Tensor Cores

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
1. How to compose MMA operations using CuTe atoms
2. Techniques for maximizing Tensor Core utilization
3. How to handle fragment-based computations
4. Synchronization patterns for efficient MMA operations
