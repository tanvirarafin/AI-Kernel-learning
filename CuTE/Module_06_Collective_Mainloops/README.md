# Module 06: Collective Mainloops

## Overview
This capstone module integrates all previous concepts into complete, production-ready kernels implementing the full producer-consumer pipeline with collective operations.

## Key Concepts
- **Producer-Consumer Pipeline**: Coordinating data loading, computation, and storing
- **Collective Operations**: Threads working together in coordinated patterns
- **Kernel Orchestration**: Complete kernel lifecycle management
- **Performance Optimization**: End-to-end optimization strategies

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will understand:
1. How to orchestrate complete kernels with multiple phases
2. Producer-consumer synchronization patterns
3. Integration of all CuTe components into cohesive systems
4. Performance profiling and optimization techniques

## Building on Previous Modules
This module synthesizes all concepts from Modules 01-05 into complete, optimized kernels that demonstrate the power of CuTe's compositional approach.
